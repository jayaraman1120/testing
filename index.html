         <p>Formed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, Hybrid Theory (2000), which was certified diamond by the RIAA in 2005,
              and multi-platinum in several other countries.[1] Their second album, Meteora (2003), continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, 
              and was followed by extensive touring and charity work.[2] Having adapted nu metal and rap metal to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in their first two albums,[3][4][5] the band explored other genres on their third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007).
             The album topped the Billboard charts and had the third-best debut week of any album that year</p>
